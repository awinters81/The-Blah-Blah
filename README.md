### ___Full User Story:___ <br>

AS A social media startup<br>
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database<br>
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data<br>
GIVEN a social network API<br>
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application<br>
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database<br>
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts<br>
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON<br>
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia<br>
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database<br>
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia<br>
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list<br>
